Install required powershell moduleb. Create the Kerberos objectc. Set Kerberos connection Configure Intune Policy*NOTE – We will use configuration policies here so they are all in one spot, you may read documentation that WHB can be set under device enrollment and this is true, they achieve the same end result, but it puts the config in two different places.a. Create a Windows Configuration Policy for Windows Hello for Business configuration.b. Create a configuration profile for cloud trust setup Testinga. Target test groupb. Test devices via force sync from client*NOTE - Intune tries to notify devices of policy updates within 5 minutes of publishing, but if there is a delay or issue for any reason it may mean you have to wait 24 hours for the device to check-in, this way we force that update on the client. c. Verify status via logsCreating the Azure AD Kerberos Object From an elevated powershell prompt execute: Install-Module -Name AzureADHybridAuthenticationManagement -AllowClobber Accept the prompt for untrusted repository ‘PSGallery’ to complete installation. After installation we will create the kerberos object utilizing this command:# Specify the on-premises Active Directory domain. A new Azure AD# Kerberos Server object will be created in this Active Directory domain.$domain = &quot;LostInCloud.com&quot;# Enter a UPN of an Azure Active Directory global administrator$userPrincipalName = &quot;administrator@LostInCloud.onmicrosoft.com&quot;# Enter a domain administrator username and password.$domainCred = Get-Credential# Create the new Azure AD Kerberos Server object in Active Directory# and then publish it to Azure Active Directory.# Open an interactive sign-in prompt with given username to access the Azure AD.Set-AzureADKerberosServer -Domain $domain -UserPrincipalName $userPrincipalName -DomainCredential $domainCredYou will need to replace the values for $domain and $userPrincipalName with the correct details for your environment.The above script is assuming that we are utilizing a form of modern auth. If you are not using modern auth refer to this Microsoft documentation for other example scripts.Configuring Intune policies for enablement and Cloud Trust configurationWe will define a user group to target for our example “WHFBCloudTrustUsers”. Both of the required policies will be assigned to this group. Begin by creating a new configuration profile Templates &amp;gt; Identity Protection. Give it a fitting name/description and continue. Lets move into defining our Hello config. Below is an example of what would be fitting for most environments. These settings are fairly straight forward, The option for Pin recovery should be discussed with your security team and additional config may be needed for other third-party MFA providers.    Something to note here is that enabling “certificates for on-prem resources” will disable cloud trust.  Now we will create another configuration profile this time choosing Templates &amp;gt; Custom. Fill in the name and description as needed and continue Create the OMA-URI: ./Device/Vendor/MSFT/PassportForWork/tenant ID/Policies/UseCloudTrustForOnPremAuth    Replace tenant ID with the one that correlates to your environement. This can be found easily at Set Data Type: Boolean and Value: True Once these policies are defined and assigned to our target group, we will do a force sync on a device to quickly retrieve the policies and test provisioning. A sign out and sign in on the test device should present the user with steps to configure biometrics if applicable, and configure a pin.ValidationIf we hop over into event viewer and navigate down to Applications and Services Logs\\Microsoft\\Windows &amp;gt; User Device Registration we should be presented with the status’s of the pre-req checks for the partial TGT before provisioning begins. This test has 3 states: Yes and No are self explanatory, Not tested is acceptable for devices that are AADJ only as this pre-req check is skipped for them as no line fo sight to the local DC is needed for signin.We can also verify these checks using ‘dsregcmd /status’. Furthermore, if we execute ‘klist’ we should be able to verify our cached kerberosTGT tickets after provisioning is completed.Thats all there is to it. Utilizing this method puts your environment in a good place to begin looking at FIDO implementation for the future!" }, { "title": "MMS MOA 2022", "url": "/posts/mms-moa-2022/", "categories": "", "tags": "mms, intune, mecm, conference", "date": "2022-03-17 22:30:00 +0000", "snippet": "Midwest Management Summit at Mall of America May 1st - 5th 2022https://mmsmoa.com/Its finally going to happen… I tried 2 years ago to attend, but a force blew through our world and wreaked havoc on any potential social gatherings.

I have been to a few conferences over the year, but this is the first one that specifically relates to my interest and work.

There was a time when you had to hunt down the SID for the GA role, or AAD device admin role, as well as any others you wanted to define on the local level. After aquiring these you would need to create or modify an existing configuration and assign them to your device groups.Thanks to the great Intune team up at Microsoft they ahve provided us with a new way achieve our goals.*Devices MUST be on 20H2 or newer to support this feature*In your Endpoint Management portal navigate to “Endpoint Security in the left pane” and select “Account Protection”Creating the policyYou will begin by creating a new policy selecting your platform as Windows 10 and later and selecting “Local user group membership”As you see in the screenshot above, you are now able to select the local groups you want to add to. Administrators Users Guests Power Users Remote Desktop Users Remote Management UsersYou are able to add multiple groups per policy. I would however suggest creating a policy for each Local group and/or device groups for different use cases.The middle field is were we will select our action. Add (Update) – Allows addition of members to the specified group while retaining current members Remove (Update) – Removes members of the specified group while retaining current members Add (Replace) – Replaces current members of specified group with new members.For our final configuration item we are able to define our User selection type.

Since 2018, I have worked with Intune and Configuration Manager in an enterprise environment. I entered your typical blue collar career at a manufacturing company and worked many years on on the production line. It was good, honest money. However, I knew that I had a passion for technology and my wife supported me into chasing the dream I had had for as long as I can remember. My career began initially as a PC Tech which lasted a little over a year. In 2018, My skill set had expanded, I was able to fill a vacancy as an Desktop Systems Engineer. This was my first experiance with SCCM, and little did I know at the time, this oppurtunity would define my career and goals for the next 4 years.LostinCloud.com is my attempt to begin engaging with the Modern Endpoint Management Community. There are many struggles I’ve had since 2018 that this community has helped me with. While be it uknowingly, people like Adam Gross, Peter Vanderwoude, Rudy Ooms and others have mentored me through walls I’ve hit while dealing with new implementations and configurations via their blogs.I hope I can produce and provide a sliver of the knowledge and help that so many other great contributors in our community have.
