Its finally going to happen... I tried 2 years ago to attend, but a force blew through our world and wreaked havoc on any potential social gatherings. Now that mandates are lifting and the world has began to open back I have been afforded the oppurtunity to attend this years summit.  
This will be my first time attending MMS and I am absolutley thrilled at the oppurtunity. I have been to a few conferences over the year, but this is the first one that specifically relates to my interest and work. I hope to take this oppurtunity to network with other like minded individuals and digest all the knowledge I can from some of the communities brightest.  

There are going to be some great speakers and presentations throughout the weeks. Here are some I am looking forward to:  
- [Build Secure Automations for Intune Managed Devices](https://mms2022atmoa.sched.com/event/y0yX/build-secure-automations-for-intune-managed-devices)  
- [How to Migrate In-Place AD Joined Workstation to Azure AD Join](https://mms2022atmoa.sched.com/event/y5VT/how-to-migrate-in-place-ad-joined-workstation-to-azure-ad-join)  
- [PowerShell for Padawans](https://mms2022atmoa.sched.com/event/y5Vu/powershell-for-padawans)  
- [Deploy and Manage applocker like a pro with Microsoft Intune and Log Analytics](https://mms2022atmoa.sched.com/event/y0yo/deploy-and-manage-applocker-like-a-pro-with-microsoft-intune-and-log-analytics)  

and a ton more..
