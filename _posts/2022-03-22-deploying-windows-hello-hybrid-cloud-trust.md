### Accessing on prem resources is easier than ever!
This is now the default recomendation for any environment where certificate issuance is not needed.  
The process we are outlining below will be for full AAD joined devices, if you are utilizing HAAD (Hybrid join), you can deploy this method via group policy for step 2.  

*Do note that for HAAD there is an added check before provisioning to verify DC connectivity.*

<ins>Prerequisites<ins>  
- Windows 10 21H2 or Windows 11  
- MFA - Any provider  
- Windows Server 2016 or later DC's  

## Outline of steps  
1.	Configuring Azure AD Kerberos   
    a.	Install required powershell module  
    b.	Create the Kerberos object  
    c.  Set Kerberos connection  
2.	Configure Intune Policy  
    ```*NOTE â€“ We will use configuration policies here so they are all in one spot, you may read documentation that WHB can be set under device enrollment and this is true, they do the same things, but you it puts config in two different places.```  
    a.	Create a Windows Configuration Policy for Windows Hello for Business configuration.  
	b.  Create a configuration profile for cloud trust setup    
3.  Testing  
    a.  Target test group  
    b.  Test devices via force sync from client  
    ```*NOTE - Intune tries to notify devices of policy updates within 5 minutes of publishing, but if there is a delay or issue for any reason it may mean you have to wait 24 hours for the device to check-in, this way we force that update on the client.```   
    c.	Verify status via logs
